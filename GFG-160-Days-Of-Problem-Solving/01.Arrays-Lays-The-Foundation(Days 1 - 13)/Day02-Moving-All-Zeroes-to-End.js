/**
 * Question : 
 * Move all zeros to end of array
Last Updated : 15 Nov, 2024
Given an array of integers arr[], the task is to move all the zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of all non-zero elements.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.


Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: arr[] = [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.

/**[
 * Naive Approach] Using Temporary Array â€“ O(n) Time and O(n) Space
 * The idea is to create a temporary array of same size as the input array arr[].
 * First, copy all non-zero elements from arr[] to the temporary array.
 * Then, fill all the remaining positions in temporary array with 0.
 * Finally, copy all the elements from temporary array to arr[]. */

// Time complexity: O(n), as we are traversing the array three times.
// Auxiliary Space : O(n), as we are using a temp[] array to move all the zeros.

function pushZerosToEnd(arr) {
  //code
  const n = arr.length;
  const temp = new Array(n);

  let j = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] !== 0) {
      temp[j++] = arr[i];
      // console.log(temp)
    }
  }
  // console.log(j)
  while (j < n) {
    temp[j++] = 0;
    // console.log(temp)
  }
  // copy from temp[] to arr[]
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] = temp[i];
  }
  console.log(arr);
}

// arr = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0];
// arr = [10, 20, 30]
// arr = [0,0]

arr = [3, 5, 0, 0, 4];
pushZerosToEnd(arr);
